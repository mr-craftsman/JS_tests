Create pizza.js and pizza.html.
The page contains pizza order form.
There are checkboxes, to choose toppings.
Every topping price is held within 'data-price' attribute.
Create several events, so that :
-after ticking the checkbox a proper order price will be shown
-after sending out the form, within 'page-info' element, a text like "Total sum is [order price]" would appear.
Clicking the button triggers default action to reload the page. Block it, to see 'page-info' text value.
-two special checkboxes - 'clear' that clears all options, and 'check all toppings' that checks all.
