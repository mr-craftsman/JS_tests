Filtered images gallery.
Images with specific tags will be hidden - after entering tag name into input, specific images should appear/disappear.
1). Using div with proper id to create HTML file.
2). Add DomContentLoaded event, check in console.
-assign to vars : all gallery images, appear button, disappear button, input form for tags.
Check in console.
3). Add events to buttons, check in console.
4). Change events, so that they will write input into variable, show input tag, and clear it.
5). Change event, so that additionally, it would show all tags for all images (using loop and dataset)
6). Change events, so that they will only show just the tags, containing input wording (use indexOf)
7). Change events, so that instead of showing image tag (all the time just for those with proper tag), an image would gain or lose 'invisible' class.
8). Test and optimize.
