Let and const
0). Create your environment (npm init, modules, webpack with outgoing js/out.js)
1). Variables scopes.
Create within js file two variables : let and const.
Check out their scope, using:
-loop
-function
-code block {}
2). Use code from prepared js file ex02.js.
Code shows where variable created by let and const is visible.
Run the script, test in console, comment.
3). Use prepared code ex03.js
Run, test, comment.
4). Create in js a for loop, that shows 'i' variable 10 times.  Initialize the variable 'i' as a var between 0 and -10.
Try show 'i' outside the loop. What is the result ?
Create second same loop below, with a different name ('j'), initialize it as a let. Try show 'j' outside the loop. What is the result ?
5). Use ex05.js. Try modyfing the variables. Comment on it.
6). Create a function IIFE (anonymous), that would write 'hello world' in a console.
7). Create a function IIFE (anonymous), that would write in a console some sort of a parameter, that was passed to that function.
