More arrays operations.
1). create a function getNumber, with 2 arguments - number and array. Function has to return boolean, depending on wether the number is in an array or not.
2). create a function createIdentityMatrix, with 2 arguments - integers - rows and columns. Function has to return 2d array - identity array, with value '1' going diagonally from top-left to bottom-right.
Use nested loops.
3). Create array of objects - 'planets' - about 8 planets of solar system and information about them.
Create a function sortPlanets(planets), that returns new array - with sorted planets, according to some data, ex. moons number.
4). Create function addTheSameNumbers, with 2 arguments - number and array. Function has to return the sum of all elements from array, that are equal in value to first argument. If not present - return null.
5). Create a function 'factors' with 1 argument, a number greater than zero. Function has to return an array cointaining all dividers of an argument number, in descending order. If no dividers - return empty array.
6). Create a function getMissingElement, with 1 argument - an array containing integers in ascending order. Function has to return first missing number - missing from ascending order. If sequence is fine - return null.
7). Create a function - getLastNumbers, with 2 arguments - number and array. Function has to return an array containing that many last numbers from array, as many is in first argument. If there is no first arg, or not a number - return empty array.
