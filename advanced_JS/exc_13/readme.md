Arrow functions.
(npm init, modules, webpack outgoing js/out.js)
1). Use ex01.js, add function countLetters, that will count students names length, and writing it into an array nymberOfLetters.
Students array is passed to the constructor, during object creation, by using 'new'. 
Show new array in a console.
2). Using arrow function... create a function that writes hello world in a console.
3). Create function with one parameter, a number - it will be multiplied by 2, returns a result. Set a default value for the parameter. Result in console.
4). Create a function with 2 parameters (numbers), that returns the bigger one. Result in a console.
5). Create a function getSecondMaxNumber(array), with an array as an argument. It has to return a second greatest number form array.
6). Create a function , that calls itself (IIFE), and that would return a parameter passed to it.
7). Create a function, with a parameter - an integer between 1-10. Set a default value for that parameter. 
Within a function - run a function setInterval - that will write in console "Hello" and a counter, counting, how many times it has setInterval been triggered.
When counter reaches parameter value, setInterval should be removed.
8). Using ex08.js, add a function generateLinks, that will use an array with webpages names, will create a new array with links to those webpages.
Put generated addresses to the 'a' elements in a list with 'menu' class, index.html file. (maybe use jQuery)
9). Use ex08.js. The object "dog" has an incorrect setName method. Fix it.
10). Use index.html - there are several div elements with 'span' and 'ul' list. Use ex10.js, and make it so, that after hovering over 'span', the 'ul' will expand.
Remember to use arrow function.
