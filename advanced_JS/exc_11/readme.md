1). Calculating number of characters in a string.
Create an array with cities names, create a new array with a number of characters in every name, i the same sequence,
2). Create a function randomize(param1, param2, callback)
First params are -  2 numbers that represent the range , where we will roll the numbers.
Las param is an anonymous function, that shows (in a log) rolled number.
Let the randomize() function check if callback is a real function before calling it.
