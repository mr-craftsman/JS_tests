Ul with, nested uls. Sample 2 levels.
1). Order out HTML, with proper classes.
2). Add DomContentLoaded event, check in console. Then assign all main list elements to vars. Assign to array. Check in console.
3). To every list element in var, add 2 events :  mouseover, mouseout, check in console.
4). Change events, so that it will find nested list of element hovered on. (nested ul)
5). Chenge events, so that message console from 3, will appear only then, if nested list exists (returned other than null)
