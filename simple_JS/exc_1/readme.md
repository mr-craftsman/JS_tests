This is a series of simple JS excercises.
Just to refresh my skills in HTML, CSS, JS and GIT.

First one.

Create a simple count function, with an int 1-10 as parameter.
Within that function, create a setInterval function.
Nested function will write a text to a console log, and will
have a counter thet will count setInterval inits.
When a counter reaches the parameter, setInterval is to be removed.
