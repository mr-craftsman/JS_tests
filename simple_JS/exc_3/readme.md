Multi-dimensional arrays.
1). Create a function with a 2-dimensional array with integers as an argument. Function returns a new array - of booleans. True is, when every element of any specific nested array is even, false is, if any is odd.
2). Create a nested array of different types and values and lengths. Like
let temp2Array = [
    [2, 3, 5, 7],
    [true, false, true, false],
    [212, 152, 99],
    ["John", "Wick"],
    [3, 12, 5, 8],
];
Create a function thet generates a pair of random numbers, shows them, and then shows proper elements of your temporary array.
3). Regarding your temporary array:
Show first dimension of aray in a loop.
Show length of each nested array in a loop.
Show each and every element in array (iterate, like a nested loop).
4). Create a function with a 2d array as an argument. Function returns a console log of this argument array - show each element of it.
5). Create a new array and pass it as an argument to a function form point 3. Optional - modify it to show it in a new html table.
6). Create a function with two integers as arguments, they represent rows and columns.
Function creates and returns a new array - with proper rows and columns, as arguments. Each element is to be a consecutive integer, start counting from 1, up to amount to fill the array.
7). Take the array form point 6, and create a set of new arrays, one dimensional : with elements beeing an average of numbers form nested array, a multiplication of all elements, and 2 sorted array - increasing and decreasing.
Do it in a console log, and then as a new html table.
